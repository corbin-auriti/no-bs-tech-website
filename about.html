              <h2>Who runs the business?</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;">
                Growing up in Calgary, I was fortunate to have an incredibly supportive family, who helped my entrepreneurial spirit since I was 9 or 10 years old. By raking leaves for neighbours, and starting who knows how many ice tea & baked goods stands, I found my footing for and yearing for community connection. Around the same time I got interested in electronics after going to the Western Canadian Robotics Society where I learned to solder, code, and make simple circuits.
                <br>
                <br>
                During high school I started working for a busy shop that did computer & phone repairs and sales. By 2014 I was partially managing the shop, and in 2015 at the age of 18 I quit to start this company out of my parents garage.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ever since, I’ve been doing my best to keep this business going, and I’m not always perfect at it, as there’s always improvements to be made and personal growth and discovery to be had.
