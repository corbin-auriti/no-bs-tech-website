              <h2>Valuing You and The Community üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà ‚úäüèø</h2>
              <p>
                Valuing you means respecting you, the client, in ways such as honouring your time and privacy, which are in short supply these days. 
                This also means valuing you as an individual, group, identity and community in ways that go unspoken. We ensure that everyone feels welcome and accepted in any way we can.

              <h2>Honesty</h2>
              <p>
                We believe it's up to us to be transparent, never try to exaggerate a problem to get more money out of you. For small businesses, this means we prioritize your best interests and ensure that our recommendations are both cost-effective and beneficial for your operations, not what might make commission. If your device is still under warranty with the original manufacturer, and they can fix it for a lower price or even free, we will always let you know.

            <p>
              If we don't think we are the best option to help you, we'll happily help find you info for somewhere else that could help you best in that situation. We want to be a trusted resource of information for your tech needs, sometimes this entails us not taking your business just for the sake of making money.

              <p>
                All reviews we have were posted only by our real clients at their own discretion. We never pay anyone or give any discounts to get a good review. While we do ask our clients if they would like to review us as it helps us out, we do this some time after their service, and make sure to tell them to write a review based on their honest experience, good, bad or somewhere in between.
